											<h2>About Me</h2>
											<h3>A General Overview</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 18th, 1988
										</p>
										<p>
											My earliest job was working for the family contracting business doing industrial, commercial and residential construction work.
											At the age of 23 I enlisted in the United States Army. During my 10 year tour on active-duty I served in numerous leadership roles managing equipment and personnel.
											Among these roles I served as a Team Leader, Squad Leader, Motor Sergeant, Platoon Sergeant and Vehicle Electrical Systems Instructor. In June of 2022, I voluntarily transitioned out of the
											Army as a Staff Sergeant with an honorable discharge. 
										</p>
										<p>
											While in the Army I met the love of my life Jenni, who was also on active duty. We were married in South Korea on September 17th 2016. We have two Awesome kids, Our son Damian is 9 and our daughter Jane is 5.

										</p>
										<p>
											After seperating from the Army we moved to Phoenix, AZ to be closer to my wife's family. After transitioning to civilian life I worked as a Automotive Body Repair Techician for Caliber Collision.
											I was Good at the job and Caliber was a decent employer. However, I was not happy. So I decided to challenge myself and make a change. I found Vschool online, and started to learn how to program.
											I enjoy learning new skills and problem-solving, so the coursework was perfect fit. After writing my first few lines of code, I was hooked. I finished the coding bootcamp Vschool in Septmber 2023.
										</p>
										<p>
											After receiving my certificate in Web Development, Vschool offered me a job as a TA, where I am currently still working.
											Working as a TA is rewarding but, I am looking for the next big challenge. I am activly searching for a full time or part time job as a Web Developer to employ my
											skills and learn new ones!
